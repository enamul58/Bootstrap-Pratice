			<h3>Object</h3>
			Object-oriented programming (OOP) opens the door to cleaner designs, easier maintenance,
			and greater code reuse. The proven value of OOP is such that few today would
			dare to introduce a language that wasn’t object-oriented. PHP supports many useful
			features of OOP, and this chapter shows you how to use them.
			OOP acknowledges the fundamental connection between data and the code that works
			on that data, and it lets you design and implement programs around that connection.
			For example, a bulletin-board system usually keeps track of many users. In a procedural
			programming language, each user would be a data structure, and there would probably
			be a set of functions that work with users’ data structures (create the new users, get
			their information, etc.). In an object-oriented programming language, each user would
			be an object—a data structure with attached code. The data and the code are still there,
			but they’re treated as an inseparable unit.
			In this hypothetical bulletin-board design, objects can represent not just users, but also
			messages and threads. A user object has a username and password for that user, and
			code to identify all the messages by that author. A message object knows which thread
			it belongs to and has code to post a new message, reply to an existing message, and
			display messages. A thread object is a collection of message objects, and it has code to
			display a thread index. This is only one way of dividing the necessary functionality into
			objects, though. For instance, in an alternate design, the code to post a new message
			lives in the user object, not the message object. Designing object-oriented systems is a
			complex topic, and many books have been written on it. The good news is that however
			you design your system, you can implement it in PHP.
			The object, as union of code and data, is the modular unit for application development
			and code reuse. This chapter shows you how to define, create, and use objects in PHP.
